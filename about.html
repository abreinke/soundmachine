      <h1><center>Project Description</center></h1>
  <h2>This project is meant to create storm sounds, some of which were original recordings.  It's an extremely personal piece since I had a phobia of storms for awhile.  I eventually grew out of the fear but I want to help others overcome similar phobias, especially ones which are related to storms.</h2>
